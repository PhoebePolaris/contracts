==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: FundForwarder
Function name: fallback
PC address: 380
Estimated Gas Usage: 3164 - 38481
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.

==== Unprotected Ether Withdrawal ====

Anyone can withdraw ETH from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent an equivalent amount of ETH to it. This is likely to be a vulnerability.
